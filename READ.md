This is the first time addding the git after learning it, dammm it's a good thing even though i only  know the basics but still quit impressed with it. So if you'r reading this no need to look into the code's commits since they are not related to the code inside, they were just used to learn the basics for myself. Also the code the repositry is jus tthe basic client server code for the basic lab task in which we have to create the basice whatsapp alike code. feel free to use it since i ot it from friends who got it from gpt or maybe github who knows...
